### Map-Reduce Simulation Properties
## up to 128 460, by using the 3 default files in conf/mapreduce/load
#mapReduceSize=100000
#
### Verbosity level
#isVerbose=true
#
### Load for the MapReduce jobs
##loadFolder=conf/mapreduce/load
##loadFolder=conf/mapreduce/bulk
#loadFolder=conf/mapreduce/bulk-load
#
##Proportional to the invocations of map().
#filesRead=72
#
#### Hazelcast Properties
### For Map-Reduce Simulations
#hazelcastXml=conf/mapreduce/hazelcast.xml
## For Cloud Simulations
hazelcastXml=conf/local/hazelcast.xml


## Cloud Simulation Properties
# For CloudSim simulations, always provide the noOfUsers property.
noOfUsers=200
noOfDatacenters=15
noOfHosts=20
noOfVms=200
noOfCloudlets=400
isRR=true
# How many Hazelcast instances to be spawn at once.
simultaneousInstances=1
# How many executions are run in parallel
noOfExecutions=1
# Enter workload to load the cloudlets with a series of
# heavy mathematical operations.
withWorkload=false
#
#
## Health-Monitor properties
# Mention timeBetweenHealthChecks property along with the params,
# to enable health checking.
timeBetweenHealthChecks=10
## Params
#highThresholdProcessCpuLoad=0.15
#lowThresholdProcessCpuLoad=0.02
#
#
#### Auto Scaler properties
#maxNumberOfInstancesToBeSpawned=3
###in seconds
#timeBetweenScalingDecisions=60
##mode: auto - for scaling up.
## adaptive - for adding existing instances adaptively into
## the simulation cluster, based on the load.
#scalingMode=adaptive
